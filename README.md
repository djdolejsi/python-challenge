# python-challenge

The python challenge was broken into two parts.

The first part i was suppose to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. I was tasked to analyze the records and calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition my final script has to contain code that would export a text file with my result and to put that into the analysis folder.

The second part i was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. i needed to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

This script also had to contain code that would export a text file with my result and to put that into the analysis folder.
